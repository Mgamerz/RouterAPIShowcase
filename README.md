RouterAPIShowcase - Router CPU Monitor
=================

This small python program polls the router every 150ms for CPU information and graphs it in realtime, like task manager 
and activity monitor does for desktop operating systems.

The graph doesn't fully line up for some reason when the CPU usage is high. I can't figure out why and there appears to be no reliable way to get the actual height of the drawable space.
